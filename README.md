# Amazon Clone

## Description
Welcome to my personal Amazon clone project, built using React! The goal of this project was to create a fully functional e-commerce website that mimics Amazon's layout and functionality.

Users can browse through a range of products, add items to their shopping cart, and check out securely using payment integration. In addition, users can create accounts and view their order history.

I utilized a range of tools and technologies, including:
* React.js
* Redux
* React Router
* Firebase Cloud Firestore Database and Authentication
* Stripe API
* Fake Store API

This personal Amazon clone project is a showcase of my skills in building complex web applications using React.
